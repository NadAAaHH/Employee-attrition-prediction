# Employee Attrition Prediction: What leads employees to leave their organization?
Employee attrition is a normal part of any business, but it can have a negative impact on the activities of other employees and the company's recruitment process. By understanding the reasons why employees leave, companies can take steps to address these issues and create a more positive and engaging work environment. This can lead to improved employee retention, which can save businesses money and help them achieve their goals.

By exploring and analyzing the employee data, this project aims to develop a model that can predict which employees are most likely to leave.

# Data
* **Source:** [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).
* **Dataset Structure:** 1470 observations (rows), 35 features (variables)
* **Data Type:** categorical and numerical
* **Label:** <code>'Attrition'</code> is the label in this dataset, with 'Yes' indicate leaving and 'No' indicate staying. Therefore, the label is binary.


# Model
Since this is a supervised classification problem, There were 3 types of models were devoloped:
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Network
