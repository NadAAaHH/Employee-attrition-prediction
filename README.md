# <a id="header-1"></a> Problem Definition & Objectives
### What's the Problem & Why it's Important?
Employee attrition is a normal part of any business, but it can have a negative impact on the activities of other employees and the company's recruitment process. By understanding the reasons why employees leave, companies can take steps to address these issues and create a more positive and engaging work environment. This can lead to improved employee retention, which can save businesses money and help them achieve their goals.


&nbsp;
### What's the Goal of This Project?
This project aims to develop a predictive model that can determine which employees are most likely to leave based on various information about their personal and professional history.

&nbsp;
# Dataset Analysis
#### Data Statistics
* **Source:** [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
* **Dataset Structure:** 1470 samples (rows), 35 features (variables)
* **Data Types:** 9 categorical, 26 numeric
* **Missing cells:** 0
* **Missing cells (%):**	0.0%
* **Total size in memory:**	1.1 MiB
* **Average record size in memory:** 796.8 B
* **Label:** The dataset uses the binary label <code>Attrition</code> to indicate employee turnover ('Yes') or retention ('No').

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

#### Bivariate Analysis

#### ➤ Job Level vs Monthly Income
<img src="Screenshots/JobLevel vs MonthlyIncome.png"/>

The line chart shows a nearly straight positive slope, indicating a strong correlation between `JobLevel` and `MonthlyIncome` . This means that on average, employees with higher job levels earn higher income each month.

&nbsp;
#### ➤ Performance Rating vs Percent SalaryHike
<img src="Screenshots/PerformanceRating vs PercentSalaryHike.png"/>  

The line chart shows a straight positive slope, indicating a strong correlation between `PerformanceRating` and `PercentSalaryHike` . Indicating that employees with higher performance ratings tend to receive higher salary hikes.  

&nbsp;
#### ➤ Total Working Years vs Monthly Income
<img src="Screenshots/TotalWorkingYears vs MonthlyIncome.png"/>  

The line on the graph shows a general trend of increasing `MonthlyIncome` with increasing `TotalWorkingYears` . However, there is a dramatic increase at `TotalWorkingYears` of 20. Suggesting that employees with 20+ years of experience receive approximately twice the income compared to those with less than 20 years of experience. The error band is also growing with the rising trend of the line.  

&nbsp;
#### ➤ Age vs Monthly Income
<img src="Screenshots/Age vs MonthlyIncome.png"/>  

The line slopes upwards, indicating a positive correlation between `Age` and `MonthlyIncome` . This means that on average, employees earn higher income as they get older. Additionally, the growing error band as the line it goes to the right indicates an increased in the uncertainty or variability of the data.  

&nbsp;
#### Target Variable Analysis

Based on the above findings, the following factors were found to have the most impact on employee attrition:
1. Late 20's - late 40's.
2. Live closer to work.
3. Low income.
4. Newly hired (No prior experience).
5. Entry-Level.
6. Single.
7. Working in Research & Development department.
8. Either Laboratory Technician, Sales Executive or Research Scientist.

# Model Development
Since this is a **supervised binary classification problem** , several the classification models were trained and tested. The three best-performing models were:
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  
&nbsp;
### Evaluation
To evaluate the models performance, the following metrics were measured:
* Confusion matrix
* Precision
* Recall
* Accuracy

&nbsp;
### Performance

| Model | Accuracy    | Precision    | Recall    | Confusion matrix    |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Random Forest | 86.68 %   | --   | --   | --   |
| Logistic Regression | 75.54 %   | --   | --   | --   |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 87.96 %   | --   | --   | --   |

&nbsp;
# Conclusion
After conducting the results of the models, we can conclude the top Reasons why employees leave the organization:
* No Overtime: This was a surpirse, employees who don't have overtime are most likely to leave the organization. This could be that employees would like to have a higher amount of income or employees could feel that they are underused.
* Monthly Income: As expected, Income is a huge factor as why employees leave the organization in search for a better salary.
* Age: This could also be expected, since people who are aiming to retire will leave the organization.
  
Knowing the most likely reasons why employees leave the organization, can help the organization take action and reduce the level of Attrition inside the organization.
